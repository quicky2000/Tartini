Install instructions for Tartini (version 1.2.1)

To compile Tartini 1.2.1 from the source:

Step 1.
Make sure the following libraries are installed on your system
- Qt 5.x
- GLU
- Alsa
- fftw3   (configured with the --enable-float option)
- Qwt 6.x
(Fttw and Qwt could be downloaded from http://www.tartini.net but osme links are broken)
Website for FFTW : http://www.fftw.org/download.html
Website for QWT : http://qwt.sourceforge.net/

For Ubuntu users the previous packages can be installed using
apt and the following packet names: qt5-default libqwt-qt5-dev libfftw3-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libqt5opengl5-dev

For MacOS, the packages can be installed using Homebrew:
- brew install qt (tested with 5.14.1)
- brew install qwt (tested with 6.1.4)
- brew install ffftw (tested with 3.3.8_1) Note: comes pre-configured with --enable-float
No need to install GLU or Alsa
To enable building/running with Xcode, run 'qmake -spec macx-xcode pitch.pro' and open tartini.xcodeproj

Step 2.
Edit pitch.pro and edit MY_TARTINI_PATH if you want to build from another directory


Step 3.
At the command prompt (from in the directory) type:
qmake pitch.pro       - This will generate a Makefile
make                  - This will compile the executable called tartini.
lrelease pitch.pro    - This will generate the translations for tartini supported languages

Buuild can also be performed using CMake
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make

Note: To compile on Windows you need to use MinGW (www.mingw.org),
since Qt4 is not supported for Visual Studio under the GPL edition.

Note: qmake comes as part of the Qt5 package
